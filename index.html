          <p><strong>Hello! I'm Chynna!</strong>
            <br>Nice to meet you! 
            <br> I was born and raised in Flagstaff, Az, but moved to Portland, Or where I now live with my partner, our cat and our dog. I graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2015 with a bachelors degree in English. I focused my college studies on Computational Linguistics and Accent Prejudice, earning a certificate in Applied Linguistics. While in school, I worked as a floral designer, then ended up in the service industry for 5 years after I moved to Portland. Though many aspects of service industry management are rewarding, I decided to move on and started my coding journey at Epicodus in August 2021. </p>

        <p>This is a Pizza Parlor Order Page! <br> This application was created as an independent project at Epicodus to showcase proper use of JavaScript Objects, Constructors, and Prototypes. This project was created using Test Driven Development. Plain text tests can be found in the test section of the README.md. This application allows the user to make multiple selections using radio buttons to create their own pizza. When the user clicks the Order Now button, the total cost of the custom pizza will display. </p>

        <p>This is Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood <br> This Epicodus independant project was created using Test Driven Development. This application will output a list of whole numbers from 0 to the user input number. It replaces some numbers in the list with strings, following these rules, in order of importance: Rule 1: For numbers that contain a 3, the entire number is replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?" Rule 2: For numbers that contain a 2, the entire number is replaced with "Boop!" Rule 3: For numbers that contain a 3, the entire number is replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

The purpose of this Epicodus assignment was to effectively use jQuery and branching to return and show a result. Text input, dropdown selections, and radio buttons are used to receive user input.</p>
