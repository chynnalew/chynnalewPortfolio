          <p><strong>Hello! I'm Chynna!</strong>
            <br>Nice to meet you! 
            <br> I was born and raised in Flagstaff, Az, but moved to Portland, Or where I now live with my partner, our cat and our dog. I graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2015 with a bachelors degree in English. I focused my college studies on Computational Linguistics and Accent Prejudice, earning a certificate in Applied Linguistics. While in school, I worked as a floral designer, then ended up in the service industry for 5 years after I moved to Portland. Though many aspects of service industry management are rewarding, I decided to move on and started my coding journey at Epicodus in August 2021. </p>

        </p>
        <p>This application was created to show understanding of TDD using the Red, Green, Refactor workflow and Jest. Tests were written for each function, committed before writing the corresponding business logic (after receiving a good fail), committed again after the test passes with business logic, then refactoring the tests as needed. Tha application contains the business logic for a space age calculator. The user can input their age and receive their age and life expectancy on Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. Life expectancy is calculated based on the age the user believes they will live to on earth. </p>

        </p>
        <p> This application accepts a user input USD amount and returns one of five different exchange rate currencies (based on a user selected dropdown menu). The user can also view the exchange rate in any currency contained in the API by entering the abbreviated currency name in an input field. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the following skills:
          <ul>
            <li>properly making API calls</li>
            <li>parsing data from an API response</li>
            <li>handling errors and displaying messages when there are no results returned</li>

        </p>
        <p>This application was created as an independent project at Epicodus to showcase proper use of JavaScript Objects, Constructors, and Prototypes. This project was created using Test Driven Development. Plain text tests can be found in the test section of the README.md. This application allows the user to make multiple selections using radio buttons to create their own pizza. When the user clicks the Order Now button, the total cost of the custom pizza will display. </p>

        </p>
        <p>This Epicodus independent project was created using Test Driven Development. This application will output a list of whole numbers from 0 to the user input number. It replaces some numbers in the list with strings, following these rules, in order of importance: Rule 1: For numbers that contain a 3, the entire number is replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?" Rule 2: For numbers that contain a 2, the entire number is replaced with "Boop!" Rule 3: For numbers that contain a 3, the entire number is replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

        <p>This application is a quiz that tells the user which programming language they should learn. <em>NOTE: The quiz was not created as an accurate measure of coding language preference.</em> The purpose of this Epicodus assignment was to effectively use jQuery and branching to return and show a result.
